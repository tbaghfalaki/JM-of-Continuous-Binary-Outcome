Joint modeling of associated mixed biomarkers in longitudinal studies leads to better clinical decision by improving the efficiency of parameter estimates. In many clinical studies the observed time for two biomarkers may not be equivalent and one of the longitudinal responses may have recorded in a longer time than the other one. In addition, the response variables may have different missing patterns. We propose a new joint model of associated continuous and binary responses by accounting different missing patterns for each longitudinal outcome. A conditional model for joint modeling of the two responses is used and two shared random effects models are considered for intermittent missingness of two responses. A Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is adopted for parameter estimation and model implementation.
